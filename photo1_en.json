  "description": "Press the switch\nAfter a few seconds a peculiar shape is formed in the water column. The shape is known as “VORTEX”.\nA pump draws water from the bottom and injects it tangentially at the top of the column. The tangential entry produces centrifugal force on the water molecules and it rotates. The suction force due to the pump exerts a downward pull on the water at the center.\nA combination of rotational force and downward pull results in formation of a Vortex.\nVortices do not form in calm or stagnated water.\nPresence of centrifugal force is a must for the formation of the Vortex."
