  "description": "Fusion was first achieved in the 1952 thermonuclear bomb “Ivy Mike,” and controlled fusion was realized in 1958 with the theta-pinch device Scylla-I. Notable advancements include the stellarator and tokamak (toroidal chamber with magnetic coils) designs, with the largest project, ITER – International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, under construction in France since 2013, involving seven countries – Europe, Japan, China, India, Russia, South Korea and the USA, and expected to be completed by 2026.\nOn December 5, 2022, the laser-driven fusion facility NIF achieved the ignition state for the first time."
